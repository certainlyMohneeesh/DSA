# 🚀 DSA Odyssey: Cyth's Algorithmic Adventures 🧠

Hey there, fellow code warriors! 👋 Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms** repository – where I battle bugs, conquer complexities, and occasionally question my life choices while debugging at 3 AM. ☕

I'm **Mohneesh Naidu** (aka **Cyth**), a 22-year-old wannabe cook turned software developer from India 🇮🇳. By day, I'm the Tech Lead at MachaCo.store, orchestrating e-commerce magic. By night, I'm slaying DSA dragons and building cool stuff like CRMs and crop disease predictors. Outside of code, I'm a wannabe cook whipping up experimental dishes and a music lover jamming to eclectic beats. Check out my [portfolio](https://cythical.cyth.me/) for more shenanigans!

## 💼 Work Experience
**Tech Lead at MachaCo.store** (Present) 🛒  
- Orchestrated the tech symphony for a budding e-commerce star, making sure the platform scales like a pro wrestler. 💪  
- Built and launched a Next.js powerhouse with analytics that turn data into decisions faster than you can say "ROI." 📊  
- Dived into R&D and strategy, blending tech magic with business wizardry for unstoppable growth. 🧙‍♂️  
- Crafted cloud pipelines that are secure, reliable, and budget-friendly – because who likes surprise bills? 💸  
- Teamed up with marketing mavens, logistics legends, and CX champs to weave features into the product roadmap. 🤝

This repo chronicles my journey through the wild world of algorithms. Think of it as my digital scrapbook of triumphs, facepalms, and "aha!" moments. Let's dive in! 🌊

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🏗️ ARRAYS
- **[largest_element.cpp](ARRAYS/largest_element.cpp)**: Finds the largest element in an array. Simple, but hey, every hero starts somewhere! 🦸‍♂️

### 🔧 BASIC
- **[start.cpp](BASIC/start.cpp)**: The humble beginnings – basic C++ setup and hello worlds. Because even Avengers need training wheels. 🚲

### 🔗 LinkedLists
- **[traversing_in_ll.cpp](LinkedLists/traversing_in_ll.cpp)**: Traversing linked lists. Walking through nodes like a stroll in the park... or a maze. 🌀

### 🔄 Sorting
- **[bubble_sort.cpp](Sorting/bubble/bubble_sort.cpp)**: Bubble sort – slow and steady, like a turtle on caffeine. 🐢
- **[merge_sort.cpp](Sorting/merge/merge_sort.cpp)**: Merge sort – divide and conquer, because teamwork makes the dream work! 🤝
- **[selection_sort.cpp](Sorting/selection/selection_sort.cpp)**: Selection sort – picking the best, one by one. Like speed dating for arrays. 💑

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/certainlyMohneeesh/DSA.git`
2. Navigate to a folder: `cd DSA/Sorting/selection`
3. Compile: `g++ selection_sort.cpp -o selection_sort`
4. Run: `./selection_sort` (or use the VS Code task for input/output magic! ✨)

## 🎯 Goals & Progress
- [x] Arrays basics
- [x] Linked Lists traversal
- [x] Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Merge)
- [ ] Trees & Graphs (coming soon... hopefully)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (the nightmare fuel)
